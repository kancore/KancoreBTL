My very first android app project.

Simple app for connecting with a paired bluetooth device

and then sending an array of 4 float values from two virtual joysticks (only taking into account Y axis) for controlling two dc motors on a remote arduino board

It will return the next array

(a, b, c, d)

where a and b are values for PIN 1 and 2 for motor A

and c and d are values for PIN 1 and 2 for motor B
